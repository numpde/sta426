knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Generate random lognormal samples

The command `rlnorm` generates samples from the lognormal distribution.

```{r}
n = 100
samples = rlnorm(n, mean=1, sd=1/4)
print(paste("First few:", toString(head(samples))))
```

## Histograms

Let's have a look at the histograms of the sample values, as well as of their logarithm.

```{r}
hist(samples)
hist(log(samples))
```

## Mean and variance of the sample set

The sample mean is `r mean(samples)`, while its variance is `r var(samples)`.

Note that the mean of the log is `r mean(log(samples))`, 
i.e. the function `rlnorm` takes the mean of the log as argument.
